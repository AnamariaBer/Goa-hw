            <p class="pclass">Franz Kafka was a Czech novelist and short story writer who wrote in the German language. He is universally regarded as one of the major figures of 20th century literature. His protagonists are isolated figures faced with surrealistic or bizarre predicaments and incomprehensible bureaucracies. The work explores themes of alienation, guilt and anxiety. The prose is full of torture, description of wounds, disorientation, sadomasochism, unexplained cruelty, appearance of rodents, beetles, vultures, and other grotesque creatures—all set against a background of utter hopelessness and despair. <br class="break"> 

           The term, <em>‘Kafkaesque’</em> has become an English word referring to situations like those in his novels and stories. He is best known for his novel The Trial and a short fiction, The Metamorphosis. His unique body of writing — much of which is incomplete and has been published posthumously — is among the most influential in Western literature. <br> 
                
             Kafka's work represents an extreme example of the modern concern with the individual's place in society. As modernity displaced people from traditional society's fixed meanings and family networks, Kafka exposes the emptiness and even perniciousness of a world in which meaning is not only absent, but malevolent toward the individual. Lacking a transcendent source of value, society is not a hospitable place and meaning is menacing.

            <p class="pclass2"> Kafka achieves the perfect balance between realism and the fantastical, which forces the reader to reassess our perceptions of the world. Through this tension, he explores themes of isolation, brutality, bravery, and transformation.</p>

        <p id="bioo"> Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, then capital of Bohemia, a kingdom that was then part of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. His father, Hermann Kafka (1852–1931), was described as a "huge, selfish, overbearing businessman" <br>
            Kafka had two younger brothers, Georg and Heinrich, who died at the ages of 15 months and six months, respectively, and three younger sisters, Gabriele ("Elli") (1889–1941), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942), and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). On business days, both parents were absent from the home. His mother helped to manage her husband's business and worked in it as much as 12 hours a day. The children were largely reared by a succession of governesses and servants. <br>
